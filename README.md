## Create a News item (e.g. a Blog Post)
* Go to the _posts folder
* Create a new .md file
* Follow the format of a previous post. Make special note of the content between the three dashes (---)
* .md files in the post folder should be titled, YEAR-MM-DY-Title.md
* Give the posts some description and keywords. Search engines will use it.

## Add Publications
* Go to the publications folder
* Open the .md file
* Follow the format already in the file :)
* When you add a publication, it might help (e.g. enhance SEO) to add a brief summary as a post for the News page

### Notes:
* The link "ohlalab.de" can replace ohlalab.github.io.
* Google analytics is currently sending hits to DNCKs Google Analytics panel. To change this, change the google analytics code in the _includes folder from 'UA-97378833-1' to your property ID.
* Comments are handled by disqus. DNCK needs to change the sign-in name from his email account to a new account. Disqus has lots of documentation. https://disqus.com/
* The _layout folder contains simple layouts. New layouts could be added later. The site is currently using bootstrap for layout. So, in general, follow bootstraps good documentation, and you can do just about anything. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/
* The scripts that used to fetch stuff from Impact story are broken at the moment. New scraps can be done, but this requires additional thought.
