## Create a News item (e.g. a Blog Post)
* Go to the _posts folder
* Create a new .md file
* Follow the format of a previous post. Make special note of the content between the three dashes (---)
* .md files in the post folder should be titled, YEAR-MM-DY-Title.md
* Give the posts some description and keywords. Search engines will use it.

## Add Publications
* Go to the publications folder
* Open the .md file
* Follow the format already in the file :)
* When you add a publication, it might help (e.g. enhance SEO) to add a brief summary as a post for the News page

### Notes:
* Google analytics is not currently set. To change this, insert your google analytics  property ID in the _includes/analytics.html.
* Comments are handled by ohlalab on https://disqus.com/by/ohlalab/
* The _layout folder contains simple layouts. New layouts can be added. The site is currently using bootstrap for layout. So, in general, follow bootstrap's good documentation, and you can do just about anything. https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/
