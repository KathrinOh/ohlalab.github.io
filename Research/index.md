## Multimodal interaction & integration
The visual appearance, smell, taste, sound, texture, and temperature of food all influence how we perceive, and eventually, accept or reject the food as ingestible. Our research on food perception is therefore multi-sensory in nature. We try to better describe how all these factors issue out in a final action at the neural and psychological level.

## Contextual effects & taste
We constantly sample our environment for information or cues that arouse expectations about future events. What are the neural mechanisms by which expectations shape taste perception? What are the behavioral consequences of our neural states representing food in contexts? What is the role of prior experience and knowledge on food intake?

## Food perception & obesity
What are some of the psychological and neural determinants and consequences of overeating? Our lab is actively pursuing these socially important topics.

## Visual perception of food
Together with our collaborators and vision scientists, our lab has developed a comprehensive database, Food.pics. Food.pics consists of images (and their properties) of food and non-food objects for research of food perception, eating, and appetite. You can find the link to download Food.Pics on our publications page.

## Nutrition & neuroenhancement
Food is fuel for our brains. How does nutrition affect cognitive performance?

##  Gustatory Perception
How is taste represented in the human brain? To address this question, our lab applies a range of psychophysical approaches used by the traditional sensory scientists. We are also actively assessing the reliability, validity, and practicality of these measures.
